# Input

Input template. Similar to anki's [type](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/fields.html#checking-your-answer) field, but support any number of input boxes.

To use, wrap the text you want to cloze with double curly braces, for example, {{text}}. Multiple clozes and image/formula clozes are also supported.

## Fields

All fields are consistent with the basic template.
